# FAQ

This section includes answers to questions raised during the integration process. If your question isn't listed, please contact [terminalapi@worldline.com](mailto:terminalapi@worldline.com).

## General Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I obtain an API key?">
    API keys can be requested via email by contacting the support team. Ensure that you securely store or delete the email containing the API key to prevent unauthorized access.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I use the API key?">
    Use an Authorization header with value `Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What environments are available for testing and production?">
    The API provides integration and production environments. Use the integration environment for testing purposes with a development terminal to simulate real-world transactions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is the Terminal API PCI compliant?">
    Yes, the API is PCI DSS compliant. No unmasked PCI-related data is accessible through the API, reducing compliance risks.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What should I do if I encounter an authentication error?">
    Verify that your API key is correct and active. Ensure that the request headers include proper authentication details and that you are using the correct environment URLs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I simulate transactions without affecting real data?">
    Yes, use the integration environment for testing transactions. It allows you to simulate scenarios without impacting production data.
  </Accordion>

## Transaction Types

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Reversal - Is the password always mandatory?">
    The password is mandatory when the terminal is set up in standalone mode. It is a limitation of the working mode of the terminal itself that cannot be bypassed by Terminal API.

    If you want to avoid password entry, set the terminal up in ECR Integrated mode, but then you need to print the receipts yourself.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is CardAcquisition used for?">
    The common use case is for cardholder identification without an additional transaction. We recommend using the normal payment transaction instead of CardAcquisition unless your use case requires a two-step transaction.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is ExchangeIdentification used for?">
    This is a field you can use to identify the request. It's useful for support in case of problems — think of it as a tracing ID.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What values are allowed for AbortReason?">
    Any string is allowed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Are there restrictions for TransactionReference?">
    We recommend a usable value. The invoice ID is a valid choice.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I revert only the last transaction?">
    Use the Reversal request for this.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between referenced and unreferenced refunds?">
    **Referenced refund:**
    - Linked to a specific original transaction
    - Uses the original transaction's identification in `OriginalTransaction` to process the refund

    **Unreferenced refund:**
    - Not tied to any original transaction
    - `OriginalTransaction` is not used at all
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid API Key">
    Double-check the API key for any typos. Ensure that the key has not expired or been revoked.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Service Unavailable">
    Verify your network connection and check the API status page for any reported outages or maintenance.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Transaction Failed">
    Ensure all required fields are correctly filled in the request payload. Review any error codes in the response for specific issues.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Unexpected error for one particular transaction">
    When working in test systems, sending a round number as a total amount may trigger special errors. Use numbers with decimals instead.
  </Accordion>
