# Navigating the API Reference

## Overview

The **Terminal API Reference** defines the message structure and endpoints used to communicate with Worldline payment terminals following the **Nexo Retailer v5.1** standard.

This section helps developers understand how to interpret, explore, and implement the API efficiently — from sending their first `SaleToPOIServiceRequest` to managing terminal status or reconciliation flows.

## Structure and Navigation

The reference is organized around **functional areas**:

- **Payments** – Standard and asynchronous payment requests, pre-authorizations, and refunds
- **Admin** – Administrative or configuration-related actions
- **Deprecated** – Legacy endpoints retained for backward compatibility

Use the **sidebar** to explore endpoints by tag or search directly by keyword (e.g., `Reconciliation`, `Abort`, `DeviceRequest`).

## Reading Endpoint Details

Each endpoint entry includes:

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| HTTP Method & Path | For example: `POST /api/v1/merchants/{umid}/terminals/{utid}/payments` |
| Summary & Description | Clarifying when and why to use the endpoint |
| Parameters | `umid` and `utid` identify the merchant and terminal |
| Security | All calls require a JWT bearer token |
| Request Body | Must contain a valid Nexo message, such as `SaleToPOIServiceRequest` |
| Response | Structured according to Nexo response messages |
| Examples | Real payloads demonstrating request/response behavior |

<Note>
Because Nexo messages encapsulate both the **Header** and **Body**, pay close attention to required fields such as `MessageHeader`, `MessageType` and transaction-specific blocks.

Some headers, like `NumberOfRetries` or `WebhookUrl`, are only applicable for asynchronous calls.
</Note>

## Schemas and Objects

The **Schemas** section defines every object used by the API — from `Card` and `POI` data structures to complex nested types like `SaleToPOIAdministrativeRequest`.

Each schema includes:

- **Type and format** (e.g., `string`, `int32`)
- **Required fields**
- **Field descriptions or enumerations** (e.g., `MerchantReceipt` or `CardholderReceipt` destinations)
- **References** to related request/response objects

Understanding these data models is key to creating valid Nexo-compliant payloads.

## Searching and Filtering

You can quickly locate any element via the search bar in the API interface.

Use keywords such as:

- Endpoint names (`/payments`, `/abort`)
- Object names (`SaleToPOIServiceRequest`)
- Schema components (`Card`, `POI`, `Capabilities`)

Search results display both endpoints and object definitions, allowing you to trace a property from schema to endpoint.

## Versioning and Deprecation

This documentation covers **Terminal API version 5.1-WL1.0.0**, aligned with **Nexo Retailer 5.1**.

<Warning>
Endpoints marked under the _Deprecated_ tag remain accessible but should not be used in new implementations.
</Warning>

Always review the [Release Notes](/terminal/release-notes) for updates or migration notes when a new release becomes available.
