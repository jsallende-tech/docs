## What is Nexo Retailer V5?

Nexo Retailer V5 is an open communication protocol that enables seamless, real-time interaction between a merchant's Point-of-Sale (POS) system and a payment terminal. It is part of the suite of standards defined by **Nexo Standards**, a not-for-profit association aiming to bring **global interoperability** to the payments ecosystem.

Nexo Retailer is specifically focused on the **Retailer-to-Acquirer interface** — standardizing how POS systems send requests (like payments, refunds, or reconciliations) and receive responses from payment terminals.

### Supported Use Cases

- Traditional POS terminals
- Self-service kiosks
- Headless checkout systems
- Cloud-based integrations

## Understanding the Protocol

Terminal API uses Nexo Retailer V5 as its messaging backbone. This protocol defines the structure and behavior of messages such as:

| Message Type | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| `PaymentRequest` | Process card payments |
| `ReversalRequest` | Reverse a previous transaction |
| `ReconciliationRequest` | Reconcile transactions |

All messages follow a predictable structure based on Nexo's data model, which draws on ISO 20022 principles — enabling structured, consistent parsing and validation across systems.

<Note>
While Nexo itself defines XML message structures, the Terminal API transmits those messages wrapped in JSON over REST endpoints.
</Note>

## Compatibility

The Terminal API implementation adheres to the official Nexo Retailer V5 specification, making it easy for developers with Nexo experience to integrate without needing to relearn core concepts or message structures.
