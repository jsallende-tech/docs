# Cloud Integration

Worldline Terminal API is designed to support modern, cloud-native integrations, enabling secure, scalable, and reliable communication between your backend services and our terminal infrastructure — without the need for local networking or direct terminal access.

## Cloud-to-Cloud Architecture

Terminal API leverages a cloud-to-cloud architecture, meaning that communication between your system and the payment terminal is brokered entirely through secure HTTPS requests from your servers to Worldline's cloud environment.

### Key Architectural Principles

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Direct API Integration" icon="plug">
    From your server to Worldline payment terminals — no local server or device middleware required
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cloud Routing" icon="cloud">
    Communication is initiated by your system and relayed through our cloud infrastructure

    Asynchronous responses via webhooks — no polling required

## Security Considerations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="HTTPS with HSTS">
    All API traffic is encrypted via HTTPS, with HTTP Strict Transport Security enforced to prevent downgrade attacks.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="API Key Authentication">
    Each integration uses a unique API key. This key must be sent in every request as a Bearer token:
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## HTTP Status Codes

When integrating with the Terminal API over HTTPS, your system will receive standard HTTP status codes. Understanding these responses is key to handling retries, error logging, and exception flows.

### Common Status Codes

| HTTP Code | Meaning | When It Occurs |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| 200 OK | Request successfully processed | Request received and sent to terminal |
| 301 Moved Permanently | Resource has been moved | Rarely used; may appear in test environments |
| 400 Bad Request | Malformed syntax or invalid parameters | Invalid JSON |
| 401 Unauthorized | Missing or invalid API key | Incorrect authentication header |
| 404 Not Found | Endpoint does not exist | Incorrect URLs, API versioning issues, invalid Terminal IDs |
| 408 Request Timeout | Server timed out | Latency issues |
| 429 Too Many Requests | Rate limit exceeded | Apply exponential backoff |
| 500 Internal Server Error | Unexpected server error | Retry with backoff or contact support |
| 503 Service Unavailable | Temporary unavailability | Check status page or retry later |

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Implement Retry Logic">
    For 5xx errors and timeouts, implement exponential backoff retry logic.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Handle Rate Limits">
    Respect 429 responses by implementing proper rate limiting in your client.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Secure Your API Keys">
    Never expose API keys in client-side code. Store them securely on your servers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Webhooks">
    For production, prefer asynchronous requests with webhook callbacks.
