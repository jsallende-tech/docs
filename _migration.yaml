# DevPortal Migration Tracking
# ============================
# This file tracks the migration status from the origin developer portals to the new Mintlify-based portal.
#
# LEGEND:
# -------
# Status Values:
#   - not_started    : Content exists in origin but migration has not begun
#   - in_progress    : Migration started but not complete
#   - partial        : Basic structure migrated but content is summarized/incomplete
#   - complete       : Fully migrated with all content preserved
#   - enhanced       : Migrated and improved with Mintlify components (Cards, Tabs, etc.)
#   - cross_checked  : Validated against source to ensure no fabricated content; ready for production
#   - n/a            : Not applicable (page doesn't exist in origin or is intentionally skipped)
#
# Completeness Percentage:
#   Indicates how much of the original content has been migrated (0-100%)
#
# Priority:
#   - high   : Critical documentation, should be completed first
#   - medium : Important but not blocking
#   - low    : Nice to have, can be deferred
#
# Notes:
#   Additional context about the migration status or blockers
