# SDK for Advanced App Deployment

SmartPOS program for app developers offers advanced control on app deployment in specific use cases by integrating a **dedicated SDK**.

## SDK Overview

SmartPOS Store integrates the 3rd-Party App Android SDK, a toolkit that enables Worldline partners to develop Android applications on the SmartPOS platform. The SDK simplifies integration with SmartPOS Store through predefined APIs.

This SDK eliminates integration complexity by handling all communication with the SmartPOS Store securely, allowing you to focus on building the business logic of your application.

- Your app requires parameter updates from SmartPOS Store
- Your app needs to receive cloud messages and notifications from SmartPOS Store
- You want to integrate analytics and reporting with SmartPOS Store

<Info>
The SDK is essential when you need your app to manage its lifecycle intelligently based on what the app is currently doing.
