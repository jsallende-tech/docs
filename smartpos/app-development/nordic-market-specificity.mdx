# Nordic Market Specificity

<Warning>
**For any developing partner targeting the Nordic market:**

The card networks regularly update their receipt requirements and Worldline push these changes to our terminals through new software updates. **It's important that any Nordic developing application partner follow the Worldline guidelines** so that you can automatically take part of these changes without having to issue a new release of your application every time.
</Warning>

## Receipt Guidelines

Receipt printing needs to be verified so make sure you read the following guidelines shared on our local Nordic developer portal:

<Warning>
Any deviation from these guidelines might lead to non-compliance and could require Worldline to temporarily stop the application on Worldline devices.
