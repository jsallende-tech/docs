# Using WebView

<Warning>
**Legal Disclaimer**

The application provider/Partner acknowledges and accepts that the use of the Standard WebView on terminals may entail non-compliance with PCI PTS security requirements and certain security risks and vulnerabilities of which it has been informed by Worldline and/or the terminal provider.

Examples of risks include:
- Use of terminals as "attack bots" or "eSkimmer" to collect data from credit and debit cards
- Inability to verify the authenticity of the user interface to be displayed
- Inability to verify the script executed within WebView
</Warning>

## Acknowledgment

Consequently, the Application Provider acknowledges that it shall use the Standard WebView at its own risk and responsibility.

The Application Provider further acknowledges and agrees that Worldline or any third-party terminal provider shall not be liable for any direct or indirect loss, damage or injury arising in whole or in part from non-compliance with PCI requirements in accordance with the WebView development instructions, guidelines or practices.

<Note>
Before implementing WebView in your SmartPOS application, ensure you have thoroughly reviewed the security implications and obtained necessary approvals from your compliance team.
