## E2E Functional Tests

### Summary

End-to-end (E2E) functional tests evaluate the application's functionality across the entire user journey on WL SmartPOS terminals. These tests encompass various scenarios, including typical and edge cases, to ensure that the application performs as intended and delivers a seamless user experience. By simulating real-world interactions and workflows, E2E functional tests provide comprehensive validation of the application's behavior, identifying any issues or bugs that need to be addressed for optimal performance.

### Example

In the payment and smart devices industry, an E2E functional test for a mobile payment application on WL POS terminals would involve scenarios such as initiating a payment transaction, verifying transaction details, processing different types of payment methods (e.g., contactless, chip and PIN), handling transaction failures, and generating accurate transaction receipts. These tests ensure that the application functions flawlessly from the moment a payment is initiated until the transaction is completed successfully.
