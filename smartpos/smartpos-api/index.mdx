## When to Use SmartPOS API

Use the SmartPOS API when your application needs to:

- Display terminal or merchant information to users
- Adapt behavior based on terminal capabilities
- Integrate with terminal management systems
- Access device-specific features not available through WPI

<Note>
For payment processing, use the [WPI (Worldline Payment Interface)](/smartpos/wpi/index). SmartPOS API is complementary to WPI for non-payment related terminal interactions.
