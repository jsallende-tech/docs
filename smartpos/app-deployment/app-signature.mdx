Worldline will fully support the app certification for specific terminal models. **Before the app upload** in the Store Developer Center, please share your binary file with WL Partner Management team (or WL support team) for signature and follow the instructions received from them.

The team shall sign the APK in a short time and send it back.

<Warning>
Please remember to **consistently sign next versions** of your application using the same keys.
