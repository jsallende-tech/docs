# Application Approval and Publication

Once the application is **submitted for approval** by Partner in the [SmartPOS Developer Center](https://smartpos.whatspos.com/developer/), WL will:

1. Check the completeness of the app description and screenshots provided
2. Perform a technical action of acceptance

## Publication Process

Depending on app character and information provided in the [Application Release Note](/smartpos/app-deployment/application-release-note), WL will **distribute and publish your application** to the SmartPOS Store on the respective markets/re-sellers.

## After Publication

Once published, the app is:

- Visible and ready to download on merchant terminals
- Ready for pushing operation in the Administrator Center

<Note>
The approval and publication process timing depends on the completeness of your submission and any technical reviews required.
