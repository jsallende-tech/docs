# App Deployment

<Warning>
This procedure does not apply to app development for **Valina** terminals.
</Warning>

## Registering at Developer Center

After the application is developed and tested, **and Partner contracted** for app delivery, the [**SmartPOS Store Developer Center**](https://smartpos.whatspos.com/developer/#/platformService) shall be used for deployment. The account to Developer Center for Partner is activated after contract signature, however Partner shall [**register it**](https://smartpos.whatspos.com/developer/#/register/check) by himself.

<Note>
For specific conditions of collaboration (e.g., Nordic countries) aligned with Worldline, **the test Developer Center** may be used prior to the contracting - in such case Partner should register [here](https://smartpostest.whatspos.com/developer/).
