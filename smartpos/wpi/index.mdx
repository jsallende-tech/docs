# WPI Overview

The Worldline Payment Interface (WPI) Intent-Based Interface is a type of API that allows for seamless integration between business applications and different payment protocols for the purpose of processing payment transactions.

This interface enables business apps to communicate with the payment application by using predefined intents, making it easy to process payments without the need for manual data entry.

## Why You Should Use WPI

WPI provides several important advantages when it comes to development of applications implementing payment functionality:

## How to Use WPI

The Intent-Based Interface works by defining a set of intents that specify the payment information required to process a payment. These intents can be sent from one app to another, allowing the payment processing app to retrieve the required information and process the payment. The data is transmitted between the two apps using a secure channel, ensuring that sensitive payment information is protected.

To integrate WPI Intent-Based Interface into your app, you will need to:

1. Define the intents required for payment processing
2. Include the amount to be paid, the payment method, and any other relevant payment details
3. Send these intents to the payment processing app
4. The payment processing app retrieves the information and processes the payment
